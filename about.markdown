Hello! I'm maankoe, a software engineer and data scientist. I've been lucky enough to complete both a masters and Ph.d. in computer science, largely focussing on data science and artificial intelligence over the last 15 or so years. 

I have professional interests in a wide variety areas, including (in no particular order), algorithms, machine learning, agent based systems, data compression, software engineering, [small 'a'] agile, and many more.

Outside work-life, I enjoy cycling and photography - they may feature here too.

I'm on twitter: [@maankoe](https://twitter.com/maankoe), and that's it.
